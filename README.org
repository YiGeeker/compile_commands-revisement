* Compile Datebase Revisement

This script is wrote for the compile datebase wrote in
/compile_commands.json/ which contains response file generated by
cmake, like "@CMakefiles/....../xx.rsp". It can be inlined by itself
and transform driver letter in upper case to lower case.

** Usage

Put both /cdb-revise.bat/ and /cdb-revise.py/ in the folder where
exists compile_commands.json, simply type ~cdb-revise~. Or put
/cdb-revise.bat/ and /cdb-revise.py/ together and type ~cdb-revise
/path/to/compile_commands.json~. All will be finished.
